            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2025, Nile Rafting Adventures emerged from a love for adventure and a deep appreciation for
                the Nile River's stunning landscapes. Our founders, a group of outdoor enthusiasts and river guides,
                recognized the potential for adventure tourism in the region and set out to create a company that would
                offer both excitement and education about the river's ecological and cultural significance.

                Since our inception, we have grown from a small team of passionate guides to a thriving company that
                welcomes adventurers from around the globe. We pride ourselves on our commitment to safety and
                environmental stewardship, ensuring that our activities have a minimal impact on the river and its
                surroundings. With a variety of rafting packages tailored to different skill levels, Nile Rafting
                Adventures has become a premier destination for those seeking adventure and exploration on one of the
                world's most iconic rivers.</p>
