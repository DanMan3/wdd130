        <p>Hi, my name is Daniel Bennion. I'm a 22 year old software engineering student of BYU Pathway Worldwide. I'm
            from American Fork, UT, USA. Because of my pioneer ancestorial roots, my family has lived out west ever
            since. I served a mission in the Carolinas, primarily in and around Charlotte, NC. My hope in attending BYU
            Pathway is to receive an affordable education that will allow me to provide for a family of my own one day.
